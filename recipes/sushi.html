    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sushi is any dish that consists of vinegared rice combined with other ingredients such as seafood and vegetables. When sushi is wrapped in <em>nori</em> (seaweed) and rolled, it is a sushi roll. The two most popular hosomaki are tekkamaki (tuna rolls), and kappamaki (cucumber rolls). Tekkamaki uses raw tuna, which has a pretty red color against white rice. The name tekka, "hot iron," is said to come from this color. You only need a little bit of fish for each roll.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sheets nori</li>
        <li>4 ounces sushi-grade tuna</li>
        <li>6 cups prepared sushi rice</li>
        <li>soy sauce and wasabi, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut nori in half 4 x 7 1/2 inches.</li>
        <li>Cut tuna into thin, long sticks - 1/2 inch thick and 7 1/2 inches long.</li>
        <li>Put bamboo sushi mat flat on work surface with bamboo slats left to right, so you can roll mat away from you.</li>
        <li>Put a nori sheet on top of the bamboo mat (makisu) with one of the seaweed's long sides close to the front edge of the mat.</li>
        <li>Spread about 3/4 cup of sushi rice on top of nori sheet.</li>
        <li>Place tuna horizontally on rice.</li>
        <li>Roll up bamboo mat, pressing forward to shape sushi into a cylinder. Roll from the front end of the mat, guiding with the sushi mat toward the other end.</li>
        <li>Tighten rolls like roll cakes, pulling the mat to tighten and pressing the bamboo mat firmly.</li>
        <li>Remove roll from mat.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all rolls are made.</li>
        <li>Wipe a knife with a wet cloth before slicing sushi. Cut rolled sushi into bite-sized pieces.</li>
